# Hi, I’m Austin.

I’m a software developer/engineer living in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Currently, I work as a full stack front end developer building awesome user experiences. I also own [Thumbyte](http://www.thumbyte.com), and make indie games for mobile. But not everything is about code. I'm a father, a husband, and...I guess the rest is about code.
