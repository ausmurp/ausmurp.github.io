# Hi, I’m Austin.

I’m a software engineer living in Columbus, Ohio, USA. I feel programming as an art and I strongly believe in the value of well crafted software. Currently, I work as an independant full stack and front end developer building awesome user experiences. I also own [Thumbyte](http://www.thumbyte.com) game studio and create mobile games in the little free time I have.

But not everything is about software. I'm a father, a husband, and...the rest is about software :)
