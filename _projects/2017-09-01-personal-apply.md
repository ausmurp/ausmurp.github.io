## The Tech
This project was a single page app in React with React Boilerplate (Redux, Sagas, Styled Components, Webpack), and Material Design front end, and .Net Core Web API back end. This web app was hosted on AWS EC2.

Until now, to apply for a mortgage loan you were required to fill out piles of paperwork. If you did this online it was a long process of several forms and terrible user experiences. This reduces all of that into a collection of the least possible amount of data to pull credit and apply for a mortgage loan.
