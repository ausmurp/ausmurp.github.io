#The Tech
This project was a single page app in Angular 2 and .NET Core API backend, using AWS SMS (Simple Notification Service) for text messaging between the service technician and the customer.

#The Problem
The technician has arrived at the location of the vehicle to perform service, which was collected prior to this scope. They notice it is a giant parking lot and does not have enough information to find the vehicle quickly. So they press a button in the existing technician mobile app to send a text message to the customer asking them to narrow the location and description a bit.
