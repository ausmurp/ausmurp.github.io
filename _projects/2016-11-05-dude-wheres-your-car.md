# The Tech
This project was a single page app in Angular 2 and .NET Core API backend, using AWS SMS (Simple Notification Service) for text messaging between the service technician and the customer.

# The Problem
The technician has arrived at the location of the vehicle to perform service, which was collected prior to this scope. They notice it is a giant parking lot and does not have enough information to find the vehicle quickly. So they press a button in the existing technician mobile app to send a text message to the customer asking them to narrow the location and description a bit. The message is generated from within the app so the tech does not specify the message.

# The Solution
The customer receives a text message with a link asking them to locate specifically where the vehicle is. When the link is clicked they are taken to a responsive web app presented below.
